## Project Introduction  ([Try the online version now!](https://www.klic.studio/))
[**Quick Start**](#-quick-start)

KrillinAI is a versatile audio and video localization and enhancement solution developed by Krillin AI. This minimalist yet powerful tool integrates video translation, dubbing, and voice cloning, supporting both landscape and portrait formats to ensure perfect presentation on all major platforms (Bilibili, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, WeChat Video, Kuaishou, YouTube, TikTok, etc.). With an end-to-end workflow, you can transform raw materials into beautifully ready-to-use cross-platform content with just a few clicks.

## Key Features and Functions:

🎯 **One-click Start**: No complex environment configuration required, automatic dependency installation, ready to use immediately, with a new desktop version for easier access!

📥 **Video Acquisition**: Supports yt-dlp downloads or local file uploads

📜 **Accurate Recognition**: High-accuracy speech recognition based on Whisper

🧠 **Intelligent Segmentation**: Subtitle segmentation and alignment using LLM

🔄 **Terminology Replacement**: One-click replacement of professional vocabulary

🌍 **Professional Translation**: LLM translation with context to maintain natural semantics

🎙️ **Voice Cloning**: Offers selected voice tones from CosyVoice or custom voice cloning

## 🚀 Quick Start

You can ask questions on the [Deepwiki of KrillinAI](https://deepwiki.com/krillinai/KrillinAI). It indexes the files in the repository, so you can find answers quickly.

### Basic Steps

First, download the executable file that matches your device system from the [Release](https://github.com/KrillinAI/KrillinAI/releases), then follow the tutorial below to choose between the desktop version or non-desktop version. Place the software download in an empty folder, as running it will generate some directories, and keeping it in an empty folder will make management easier.

【If it is the desktop version, i.e., the release file with "desktop," see here】
_The desktop version is newly released to address the issues of new users struggling to edit configuration files correctly, and there are some bugs that are continuously being updated._

1. Double-click the file to start using it (the desktop version also requires configuration within the software)

【If it is the non-desktop version, i.e., the release file without "desktop," see here】
_The non-desktop version is the initial version, which has a more complex configuration but is stable in functionality and suitable for server deployment, as it provides a UI in a web format._

1. Create a `config` folder within the folder, then create a `config.toml` file in the `config` folder. Copy the contents of the `config-example.toml` file from the source code's `config` directory into `config.toml`, and fill in your configuration information according to the comments.
2. Double-click or execute the executable file in the terminal to start the service
3. Open your browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:8888` to start using it (replace 8888 with the port you specified in the configuration file)

### To: macOS Users

【If it is the desktop version, i.e., the release file with "desktop," see here】
Due to signing issues, the desktop version currently cannot be double-clicked to run or installed via dmg; you need to manually trust the application. The method is as follows:

1. Open the terminal in the directory where the executable file (assuming the file name is KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64) is located
2. Execute the following commands in order:

```
sudo xattr -cr ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64
sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64 
./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64
```

【If it is the non-desktop version, i.e., the release file without "desktop," see here】
This software is not signed, so when running on macOS, after completing the file configuration in the "Basic Steps," you also need to manually trust the application. The method is as follows:

1. Open the terminal in the directory where the executable file (assuming the file name is KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64) is located
2. Execute the following commands in order:
   ```
   sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
    sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
    ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
   ```
   
   This will start the service

### Docker Deployment

This project supports Docker deployment; please refer to the [Docker Deployment Instructions](./docker.md)

Based on the provided configuration file, here is the updated "Configuration Help (Must Read)" section for your README file:

### Configuration Help (Must Read)

The configuration file is divided into several sections: `[app]`, `[server]`, `[llm]`, `[transcribe]`, and `[tts]`. A task is composed of speech recognition (`transcribe`) + large model translation (`llm`) + optional voice services (`tts`). Understanding this will help you better grasp the configuration file.

**Easiest and Quickest Configuration:**

**For Subtitle Translation Only:**
   * In the `[transcribe]` section, set `provider.name` to `openai`.
   * You will then only need to fill in your OpenAI API key in the `[llm]` block to start performing subtitle translations. The `app.proxy`, `model`, and `openai.base_url` can be filled in as needed.

**Balanced Cost, Speed, and Quality (Using Local Speech Recognition):**

* In the `[transcribe]` section, set `provider.name` to `fasterwhisper`.
* Set `transcribe.fasterwhisper.model` to `large-v2`.
* Fill in your large language model configuration in the `[llm]` block.
* The required local model will be automatically downloaded and installed.

**Text-to-Speech (TTS) Configuration (Optional):**

* TTS configuration is optional.
* First, set the `provider.name` under the `[tts]` section (e.g., `aliyun` or `openai`).
* Then, fill in the corresponding configuration block for the selected provider. For example, if you choose `aliyun`, you must fill in the `[tts.aliyun]` section.
* Voice codes in the user interface should be chosen based on the selected provider's documentation.
* **Note:** If you plan to use the voice cloning feature, you must select `aliyun` as the TTS provider.

**Alibaba Cloud Configuration:**

* For details on obtaining the necessary `AccessKey`, `Bucket`, and `AppKey` for Alibaba Cloud services, please refer to the [Alibaba Cloud Configuration Instructions](https://www.google.com/search?q=./aliyun.md). The repeated fields for AccessKey, etc., are designed to maintain a clear configuration structure.
